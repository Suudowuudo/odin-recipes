I finally finished the project of building a basic recipe website. The skills I used to build this basic recipe website were the usage of the HTML Boilerplate, Element tags, Paragraphs, Lists, and Links and images. This was a very time consuming assignment but I had fun doing it. I love seeing my website update whenever I save in VSCode! It is very Satisfying.
